      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, i'm Laura, I recently decided to pursue a career in the web-development industry, and have been learning the basics of html and css in my spare time. I currently work on a contact centre, but I can't wait for the University of Birminghams coding bootcamp to open up new possibilities for my career!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Wolverhampton, West Midlands, United Kingdom</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am really into fitness, I love weightlifting, and even studied a degree in Sport and Exercise Science. I love to travel and I am also currently learning to play the piano.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't have a dream job per say, but I want to find something which I find interesting and reqarding, and hopefully gives me the opportunity to travel to and work in different parts of the world.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Wolverhampton, a city in the West Midlands, I am living at home but am working to save up towards a deposit for my own property one day.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I recently began looking into coding and learning the basics by watching YouTube videos, and was fascinated by how interesting it was, and how great it felt to know how to piece together a simple website. I couldn't help but want to take it further, as the web development industry seems to have a lot of opportunities for varying levels of experience, so it seems as though there is nothing to stop me from pursuing this and making it my full-time career.</p>
